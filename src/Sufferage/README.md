## Steps

* For each task, determine the difference between its minimum and second minimum completion time over all resources(sufferage).
* Over all the tasks, find the maximum sufferage.
* Assign the task to the resource that has resulted in obtaining minimum completion time.
* Update the completion times in task-VM matrix.
* Iterate till all the tasks are scheduled.
