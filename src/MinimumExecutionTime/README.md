## Steps

* Minimum Completion Time 1
  *   Generating the Task-VM execution time matrix of all tasks-VM combination.
  *   For each task, find that VM which gives the minimum execution time.
  *   Bind that task to the corresponding VM.
  *   Iterate for all the remaining tasks.
  *   Execution Time
     * Eij
       * Eij = execution time of task i on VM j (cloudlet length / (VM MIPS * VM PES))
