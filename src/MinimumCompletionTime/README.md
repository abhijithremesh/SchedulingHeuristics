## Steps

* Minimum Completion Time 1
  *   Generating the Task-VM completion time matrix of all tasks-VM combination.
  *   For each task, find that VM which gives the minimum completion time.
  *   Bind that task to the corresponding VM.
  *   Iterate for all the remaining tasks.

* Minimum Completion Time 2
  * Similar to Minimum Completion Time 1
  * scheduling done after begin of simulation (guess, not the correct way)
