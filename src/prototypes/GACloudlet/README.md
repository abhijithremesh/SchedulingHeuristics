* Fitness Function = Makespan + Avg waiting time(all cloudlets) + Avg execution time(all cloudlets)
   *  Makespan = Total finish time = finish time of the last cloudlet.
   *  Avg waiting time = sum of waiting time of all cloudlets / no. of cloudlets
   *  Avg execution time = sum of execution time (actual cpu time) of all cloudlets / no. of cloudlets
