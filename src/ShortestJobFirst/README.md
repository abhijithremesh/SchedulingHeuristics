## Steps

* Shortest Job First Broker ([Types of Task Scheduling Algorithms in Cloud Computing Environment](https://www.intechopen.com/books/scheduling-problems-new-applications-and-trends/types-of-task-scheduling-algorithms-in-cloud-computing-environment))

  * Submitted the VM list to the broker
  * Before submitting the cloudlets to the broker
  * Broker sorts the cloudletlist in ascending order with respect to its length
  * The sorted cloudlet list is submitted to the broker.

* Shortest Job First Broker 2
  * Submitted the cloudlet list and VM list to the broker
  * Broker sorts the cloudletlist in ascending order with respect to its length
  * Sorted cloudletlist is bound to VM as per the First Come First Serve policy. 

* Shortest Job First Broker 3 ([Cloud Computing CPU Allocation and Scheduling Algorithms
Using CloudSim Simulator](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hicham-Gibet-Tani/publication/309111132_Cloud_computing_CPU_allocation_and_scheduling_algorithms_using_cloudsim_simulator/links/59d015774585150177ee2565/Cloud-computing-CPU-allocation-and-scheduling-algorithms-using-cloudsim-simulator.pdf))

  * The concept of this algorithm is same as that of FCFS
  * The algorithm at first chooses the task with shortest execution time, which takes the lead in the list.
  * Cloudlet is sorted in ascending order with respect to its execution time.
  * This ordering is said to reduce the average waiting time extremely. 

* Shortest Job First Broker 4
  * Submitted the VM list to the broker
  * Before submitting the cloudlets to the broker
  * The algorithm at first chooses the task with shortest execution time, which takes the lead in the list.
  * Cloudlet is sorted in ascending order with respect to its execution time.
  * The sorted cloudlet list is submitted to the broker.
